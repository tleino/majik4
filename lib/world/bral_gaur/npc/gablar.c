				  "fat undoubtedly feels very painful does not seem to be of any consequence "+

				  "something between a strenuous smile and a malicious snarl. He has a very "+
				  "thick red beard which he seems to have tucked under his belt or merely "+
				  "forgotten about when he put the belt on. If _he_ put the belt on. He is "+
				  "constantly blinking his cloudy eyes, possibly in a hopeless effort of "+
				  "improving his vision which he seems to have lost, at least to some extent. "+
				  "Bare, hairy feet are visible under the hem of his robe and pink-feathered, "+
				  "obviously worn slippers are lying on the left arm of the throne. Bits of "+
				  "pink feather can occasionally be seen flapping between his puffy toes as "+

				  "into the rock floor right next to his throne.");
