The Majik4 Skill System
=======================

File system
-----------
All skills are divided into individual files that are stored in the /skill 
-directory. 

Living objects inherit /inherit/skillsys.c in which there are all functions 
that handle skills within living objects. It is defined as SKILL_SYSTEM in
mudlib.h. 

Individual skill objects inherit /inherit/skill.c. It is defined as SKILL in
mudlib.h.

And finally there's the skill daemon, which handles all abstract skill 
activities such as skilltree handling and finding skill objects. It resides in 
/daemon/skill.c and is defined as SKILL_D in mudlib.h.

Interface
---------
An interface for invoking some of the features in the skill daemon can be
found in /command/immortal/skillctrl.c and it should be invoked normally by
using a client.

Mortals can see their skills with a short verbal description of their level, 
apart from node-type skills, by invoking /command/mortal/skills.c. If a
skill is chosen from the list, it is thrown to /command/mortal/use.c which
resolves the skill from the given string argument and calls the mortal's
living object which invokes the individual skill matching the given string in 
the /skill -directory as well as automagically adds practical experience to the
skill. This is done in the 'int use_skill(skill, die, bonuses, args)' 
-function inherited from /inherit/skillsys.c.
