			"unnoticed, until it slightly flickers and crackles with electricity. You "+
			"feel hate and anger creeping into your soul and Wrath raises it's broken "+
			"skull to let out a hollow, empty sound of mocking laughter. The bones twist, "+
			"turn and clack against each other with every step the evil creature takes, but "+
			"never fall apart, binded in a determined oath.");
