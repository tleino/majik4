			"malevolent work. Four horns of thick and twisted black obsidian "+

			"battle-scream of the Abyss. The sound of Malice's wrath shreds you "+
			"with the sharpness of a broken glass. It resounds with a low rumble "+
			"from the depths, like the cracking of Earth and you feel bones throbbing "+
			"inside your soft flesh. You can only take a short glance at the wyrm's "+
			"scales, reflecting the torments of tortured warriors, the anguished faces "+
			"of raped widows and the laments of dying children, until the hypnotic "+
			"pairs of eyes captivate you in their crossfire again.");
