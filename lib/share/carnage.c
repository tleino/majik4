			"stained with blood, skin and flesh, opening into a wide grin of "+
			"pleasure. Each one of the four arms hold a weapon of unholy "+
			"demon-forged steel, giving an impression of a walking arsenal. A "+
			"battle axe prepares to cleave you, a sword to slash, a morningstar "+
			"to maim and a spear to penetrate the heart. Carnage advances to battle "+ 
			"with his weapons circling, cutting, surrounding him with a deadly "+
			"dance, the spikes in the armor dripping blood from the hearts of his "+
			"previous victims..");
