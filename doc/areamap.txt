Coordinates & maps
==================
  We now have a new coordinate and mapping system, so I'll explain it's
  basic concepts.
  
  Gridmaps are inside areamap objects inherited from areamap.c. For example
  the worldmap is handled by "/world/worldmap" which inherits areamp.c.
  The areamap object keeps book on which gridmap is where and converts global
  coordinates into local. "/world/worldmap"->query_tile(x, y) would first
  resolve the gridmap containing tile x, y and then convert the coordinates
  into gridmap coordinates and call query_tile() in the gridmap.
  If a gridmap is created before the areamap which should contain it, serious 
  bugs will occur.
  
  When you build a new area outside worldmap you should first make a areamap
  file similiar to "/world/worldmap" which sets the gridmaps it is containing
  and their area coordinates.
  
  No function should call a gridmap file directly or use local coordinates.
  Everything should be done through areamap objects. MAPENV(object)->function()
  must be used instead of ENV(object)->function().
  The only expection to this is create_gridmap() in gridmap files where 
  descriptions, objects and such must be set with local coordinates. This
  does not concern coordinates pointing to other gridmaps such as stairs'
  target coordinates. Neither does this include monsters' wander settings or
  other settings which do not concern the gridmap directly.
  
  Take a look at "/world/worldmap.c", "/world/hilltop/hilltop1.c", 
  "/world/hilltop/hilltopcellar.c" and "/world/hilltop/hilltop1.c".
  Especially hilltop1.c and hilltop2.c show how to set some things 
  more dynamically.
  
Short summary:
 
  Every gridmap must be of size 100x100 grids.
  Every gridmap must be inside object inherited from areamap.c.
  ENV(object) must be replaced with MAPENV(object).
  Global coordinates must be used instead of local coordinates.
  The only place where local coordinates can be used is in gridmaps'
   create_gridmap() functions. This does not include monster wander settings 
   nor stairs' target coordinates on other gridmaps.
