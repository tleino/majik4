Client API

Majik4's client should have API (Application Programming Interface) for
server's use. Server should be able to open windows etc. in the client.
This document tries to describe the API.

Server side functions

OpenWindow(int width, int height, int type, string title, string data)

  The function should open window of width and height. Type specifies the
  type of the window and title specifies the title. The type can be one of
  the following:
  
    * WTYPE_TEXT   Window is used to display just plain text, colors are
	               allowed of course.
			   
    * WTYPE_SELECT Window is used to display list of items the user can select
	               and the selected item is passed to command used to invoke
				   the list.
				   
  The window is closed by client. If there is more lines than window height
  allows, then the window should be scrollable. Data specifies the contents
  of the window. ";" separates the lines.
  
  For example:
  
    OpenWindow (50, 20, WTYPE_SELECT, "Drop which item?", "a shovel;a "
	  + "dagger;a sword;");
	  
  The above example opens window of 50x20 size if allowed, if not, it is
  shrinked to size that is allowed. It should look something like this:
  
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  | Drop which item?                                 |
  |                                                  |
  | A - a shovel                                     |
  | B - a dagger                                     |
  | C - a sword                                      |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  |                                                  |
  | Z - close window                                 |
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  
  If width and height is 0 then it is as large as needed, like this:
  
  +------------------+
  | Drop which item? |
  |                  |
  | A - a shovel     |
  | B - a dagger     |
  | C - a sword      |
  |                  |
  | Z - close window |
  +------------------+
  
  It is suggested that you always use 0 as width and height. 
  
  Window is scrollable by using + and - keys, it scrolls full page and
  A-Z's are re"calculated".
  
  Open for suggestions.
