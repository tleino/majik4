GRID/WORLDMAP COOPERATION

PROBLEM
	We need to have a working system that we can easily define locations
	in worldmap and inside gridmaps. Things will get more complicated as
	the worldmap partly consists of dynamically generated gridmaps.

SOLUTION
	There will be three kinds of objects, world object, gridmap objects
	and gridobjects.

WORLD OBJECT
	A world-object (or daemon) will be created. The world object
	contains gridmap object for every location in the worldmap. Areas 
	(gridmap objects) will be preloaded into world object.
	
GRIDMAP OBJECT
	Each gridmap object has a location in world object (world_x,
	world_y). Some gridmap objects will be pre-defined (ie. areas)
	and some are dynamically created by world object. Dynamic gridmaps
	can be purged from memory when there are no longer gridobjects 
	inside them. The generation algorithm must always create identical
	maps for each location.

GRIDOBJECT
	Gridobjects are objects inside gridmap, ie. players, items.
	monsters and such.
