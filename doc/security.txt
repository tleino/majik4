Security system in Majik4

This document describes the security system in Majik. The great difference to
previous incarnations of Majik is that the main coding isn't done inside the
game anymore. All of the core components are developed under a version control
system (CVS), which only gods (or higher) have access to. 

The following security theorems are enforced in the security system when 
determining users' access to read or write certain file.

1.	An object doesn't have any access to this file, unless
		a)	The file resides in user's home directory,
		b)	none of the following exceptions apply, or
		c)	user is a god.
		
2.	All directories, that are controlled by CVS (ie. have 'CVS' directory in
	them), are read only. They can't be modified from inside the game; CVS
	should be used instead.
	
3.	Objects are allowed to save_object() into same directory they are in, 
	ie. '/daemon/time.c' is only allowed to save_object() to '/daemon/time.o'.
	The only exception for this rule is the player object, which can save
	to '/data/player/n/name.o'.
	
4.  Everyone has full access to '/open' directory.

5.	Everyone can read '/log' and '/world' directories.

6.	Only the logging daemon (/daemon/log.c) can write into '/log' directory.

7.	Insert more rules here
