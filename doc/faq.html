<dt><b>2.1. What is Majik?</b>
<dd>Majik is an Internet based computer game. It is a mixture of MUDs, 
Roguelikes and role-playing/adventure games such as Ultima. All of these
games originate from pencil and paper -based roleplaying games such as
AD&D, Rolemaster and Rune Quest and Majik hasn't forgotten it's roots.<p>

<a name="2.2"></a>
<dt><b>2.2. What is a MURPE?</b>
<dd>MURPE stands for Multi-User Role-Playing Environment.<p>

<a name="2.3"></a>
<dt><b>2.3. What is Majik4?</b>
<dd>Majik 4 is the fourth distinguishable incarnation of Majik. All of Majik's
<a href="http://majik.netti.fi/majik3.html">predecessors</a> have been essentially MUDs but Majik4 combines the old Majik
elements with new Ultima and Roguelike -type elements both technically and
in game-terms. What this means in practice is that Majik4 will feature
an external client program which allows us to use an intuitive ASCII-based
tile-graphics system (we call it "gridmap") similar to that in 
Roguelike-games, especially ADOM, while featuring a key shortcut -based
user interface as well as a prompt-based input system similar to that in
normal telnet-based MUDs. At the moment Majik4 is under development and
only open to the development team of Majik.<p>

<a name="2.4"></a>
<dt><b>2.4. When will Majik4 be open to the public?</b>
<dd>When the base code is ready. Should be fairly soon.<p>

<a name="2.5"></a>
<dt><b>2.5. Who are the developers of Majik4?</b>
<dd>The people responsible for the base code of Majik4 are listed below:<p>
<dd><a href="http://majik.netti.fi/~namhas">Tommi "Namhas" Leino</a> 
(<a href="mailto:namhas@majik.netti.fi">namhas@majik.netti.fi</a>)
<dd><a href="http://majik.netti.fi/~dazzt">Jari "Dazzt" Saukkonen</a> 
(<a href="mailto:dazzt@majik.netti.fi">dazzt@majik.netti.fi</a>)
<dd><a href="http://majik.netti.fi/~yorkaturr">Atte "Yorkaturr" Koivula</a>
(<a href="mailto:yorkaturr@majik.netti.fi">yorkaturr@majik.netti.fi</a>)
<dd><a href="http://majik.netti.fi/~harum">Otso "Harum" M&auml;kinen</a> 
(<a href="mailto:harum@majik.netti.fi">harum@majik.netti.fi</a>)<p>
<dd>There are also <a href="http://majik.netti.fi/cgi/wizlist.c">numerous other
developers</a> who will step in when the Majik 
base is	finished, but at the moment the people above are responsible for
the progress of Majik.<p>

<a name="2.6"></a>
<dt><b>2.6. Does Majik4 have a homepage?</b>
<dd>Yes, the URL for Majik's homepage is:
<a href="http://majik.netti.fi">http://majik.netti.fi</a><p>

<a name="3.1"></a>
<dt><b>3.1. Why a separate client?</b>
<dd>In the times of Majik3 we tried to create a gridmapped environment without
any external programs and faced many difficulties. Now we are able to do great
deal of the most intensive calculations in the client reducing server load and
make the user-interface much more friendlier.<p>

<a name="3.2"></a>
<dt><b>3.2. Where can I get the client?</b>
<dd>The client is not available for public download until the base code has
been finished. It will be available from <a href="http://majik.netti.fi">Majik 
homepages</a> when the time comes due.<p>

<a name="3.3"></a>
<dt><b>3.3. What platforms does the client support?</b>
<dd>The client is primarily developed under Linux (ncurses, GTK), which is 
currently the only platform supported. We will make at least version for 
Windows (95/NT), compile it for the most popular unixes and for Amiga of
course. Also, other ports might be done in the future (java, for example).<p>

<a name="3.4"></a>
<dt><b>3.4. Is the client source available?</b>
<dd>No. We won't release the source because someone could alter
the client to display more information than he/she is supposed to see.<p>
