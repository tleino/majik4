DOCUMENTATION FOR MAJIK4 MESSAGING SYSTEM

Majik4 has system for parsing names, verbs and pronomins automagically.
Messages are sent using message() sefun, for which the proper format is:
 
 message(type, int x_coord, int y_coord, int radius, string message, 
         mixed target, mixed objects, mixed exclude);
 
Type is one of the followings:
 CMD_SEE      Something a player can see.
 CMD_HEAR     Something a player can hear.
 CMD_SMELL    Something a player can smell.
 CMD_FEEL     Something a player can feel. (touch)
 CMD_TASTE    Something a player can taste.
 CMD_SENSE    Something a player can sense.
 CMD_OOC      Out of character infomation.
 CMD_INFO     Reboots, etc.
 CMD_MSG      General messages.
 
X_coord, y_coord and radius
 Source and radius of the message. Use 0,0,0 if the message doesn't have a 
 clear source on the grid.

Message:
 The actual message can contain the following tags:

  $nn = name lowercased, or forced to uppercase if proper name: orc, Harum
  $Nn = capitalized name of n: Orc, Harum
  $tn = himself, herself, itself, you/yourself, orc or Harum // This is the
  $tN = Himself, Herself, Itself, You/Yourself, Orc or Harum // target of
  $en = he, she, it or you.                                     the verb
  $En = He, She, it or You.
  $mn = him, her, it, your.
  $Mn = Him, Her, It, Your.
  $sn = his, her, its or your.
  $Sn = His, Her, Its or Your.
  $on = orc's or Harum's
  $On = Orc's or Harum's
  $pn = short description of n
  $Pn = and capitalized version
  
  n is the number of object
   objects[0] = 1
   objects[1] = 2
   $n1 = name of objects[0]
  
  {verb} = verb / pluralize(verb), all verbs should be put inside {}

Target
  Target is object or array of objects to whom the message will be sent.
  For example THIS or all_inventory(ENV(THIS))
	
Objects 
  Objects are the objects used by tags.
  Use 0 if you don't have any $ tags in your message.

Exclude
  Exclude is object(s) to whom the message will not be sent.
  With this you can exclude specific players from Target.
  This argument is optional.

Examples
 
  message(CMD_INFO, 0,0,0, "REBOOT.", users());
   
   will send message "REBOOT." to every user online.
  
  message(CMD_SEE, 0,0,0 "$n1 {smack} $t2 and $t1.", 
          all_inventory(ENV(THIS)), ({ THIS, THAT }) );
   
   THIS: "You smack Teppo and yourself."
   THAT: "Harum smacks you and himself."
   else: "Harum smacks Teppo and himself."
  
  message(CMD_SEE, 0,0,0, "$n1 {hit} $o2 left leg with $s1 $n3.", 
          all_inventory(ENV(THIS)), ({ THIS, present("elf"), 
		  present("sword") }) );
   
   THIS        : "You hit elf's left leg with your Sword of annihiltion."
   elf         : "Harum hits you with his sword."
   someone else: "Orc hits elf with his sword."
   someone else: "Harum hits Lathas with his sword."
   
   Note that the actual name player sees depends if he is familiar with
   it or not.
   
Feel free to ask and remember that all of this might not be implemented yet.
